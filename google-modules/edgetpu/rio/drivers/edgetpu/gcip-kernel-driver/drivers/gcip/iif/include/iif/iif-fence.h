/*
 * The inter-IP fence.
 *
 * The meaning of "a fence is signaled" or "unblocked" is that the fence has been signaled enough
 * times as many as the expected number of signals which is decided when the fence is initialized
 * and it has been unblocked. That says every single signaler commands are expected to signal the
 * fence (i.e., call `iif_fence_signal{_with_status}` function) even though commands weren't
 * processed normally.
 *
 * Also, unblocking a fence here is only for the kernel perspective. Therefore, the IIF driver will
 * notify the fence unblock to only who are polling the fences (via poll callbacks or poll syscall).
 * It means that if the signaler is an IP, not AP, it is a responsibility of the IP side to unblock
 * a fence and propagate an error to waiter IPs. Therefore, unblocking fence by the IIF driver will
 * not unblock the fences in the IP side unless the IP kernel driver notices the fence unblock via
 * a poll callback and asks their IP to unblock the fence.
 *
 * If the signaler IP requires a support of the kernel driver to unblock the fence in case the IP is
 * already faulty and can't notify waiter IPs, the signaler IP kernel driver can unblock the fence
 * with an error and each waiter IP kernel driver can notice it by `fence_unblocked` operator of the
 * fence manager or registering a poll callback to the fence directly and propagate the error to the
 * IP of each.
 *
 * Besides, one of the main roles of the IIF driver is creating fences with assigning fence IDs,
 * initializing the fence table and managing the life cycle of them.

 * The callback which will be called when all signalers have signaled @fence.
 *
 * It will be called while @fence->fence_lock is held and it is safe to access @fence->signaled,
 * @fence->timeline, @fence->signal_error and @fence->propagate.
 *
 * The callback must be lightweight to avoid blocking a thread who signals @fence for a long time.
 *
 * Expected logic of registering / unregistering this callback is:
 *   Before submitting a waiter command to IP:
 *     iif_fence_submit_waiter(fence, IP);
 *     iif_fence_add_poll_callback(fence, ...);
 *
 *   After a response has arrived from IP:
 *     iif_fence_remove_poll_callback(fence, ...);
 *     iif_fence_waiter_completed(fence);
 *
 * Note that the callback was registered AFTER the `submit_waiter()` function call and unregistered
 * BEFORE the `waited()` function call because those functions will acquire or release the wakelock
 * of the IP if `{acquire,release}_block_wakelock()` operators are registered to the IIF manager and
 * the poll callback would be meaningful only if the wakelock is held.
 *
 * The callback will be invoked in the spin-lock context. If the IP driver needs to handle the fence
 * unblock in the normal context, the `fence_unblocked()` operator of `struct iif_manager_ops` can
 * be considered. The operator will be invoked in a separate thread which will be scheduled once
 * @fence is unblocked. Therefore, its latency would be worse than this poll callback.
 *
 * Following is describing how to handle the fence signal.
 *
 * For single-shot fences:
 * The callback is supposed to be invoked when the signaler signals @fence as many times as the
 * number of total signalers which was decided when the fence was created and the fence has been
 * unblocked eventually. The callback must check @fence->signaled to see if the fence is actually
 * unblocked.
 *
 * Note that even though @fence->error is non-zero, @fence->signaled wouldn't be true if the fence
 * hasn't been signaled enough times. In this case, the IP driver shouldn't consider the fence as
 * unblocked. It depends on how the underlying sync-unit fence is implemented.
 *
 * For reusable fences:
 * The callback is supposed to be invoked when the signaler signals @fence which increases the fence
 * timeline and the timeline has reached any registered sync points. The callback must check whether
 * @fence->timeline has become the one that the IP driver is waiting for.
 *
 * Also, unlike single-shot fences, if @fence->error becomes non-zero, the IP driver should treat
 * the fence as errored out immediately.

/**
 * iif_fence_submit_signaler() - Submits a signaler to the fence.
 * @fence: The fence to submit a signaler.
 *
 * The signaler IP driver must call this function before submitting every single signaler command to
 * its firmware. Once a signaler command has completed either successfully or with an error, the IP
 * driver must call the `iif_fence_signaler_completed()` function to let the IIF driver know that
 * one signaler command has completed.
 *
 * I.e., submit_signaler() and signaler_completed() functions are supposed to be called like this:
 *
 *      // The IP driver is requested to submit a signaler command to the firmware.
 *      ret = iif_fence_submit_signaler(fence);
 *      if (ret)
 *              return ret;
 *      // Now the IP driver can submit the signaler command to the firmware.
 *
 *      ...
 *      (The kernel driver waits for a response from the firmware.)
 *      ...
 *
 *      // A response has arrived from the firmware or the signaler command is errored out.
 *      iif_fence_signal(fence);
 *      iif_fence_signaler_completed(fence);
 *      // The IP driver returns the response to the runtime.
 *
 * Its purpose is to track the number of signalers that have been submitted and signaled the fence.
 * If there are remining signalers which can signal the fence, the IIF driver will pend releasing
 * the block wakelock of waiters if needed until there are no more signalers to signal the fence.
 *
 * Note that this function call cannot be reverted. (The `iif_fence_signaler_completed()` function
 * is NOT for reverting the signaler submission to the fence.) Once the IIF driver notices that all
 * signalers have been submitted to @fence, it will notify waiters that it is time to submit waiter
 * commands which is impossible (or really hard) to revert. That said, the fence must be signaled
 * after this function call to unblock waiters.
 *
 * Therefore, it is recommended to call this function when the kernel driver can guarantee that a
 * signaler command will be submitted to the firmware successfully so that the fence will be always
 * signaled by the firmware according to the status of the command. (Note that we should guarantee
 * that the signaler IP firmware is the only one who will signal the fence as long as the firmware
 * is alive.)
 *
 * If any error is detected at the kernel level after this function call, but before the firmware
 * completes handling the signaler command (e.g., the signaler command submission to the firmware
 * fails, the command has been timedout at the kernel level, the kernel driver has detected the
 * firmware crash, ...), the IP kernel driver must propagate the error to the fence.
 *
 * - If an error implies that the firmware is not working or faulty so that the firmware will never
 *   signal the fence, the kernel driver can signal the fence at the kernel level directly.
 *   (See `iif_fence_set_propagate_unblock()` and `iif_fence_signal_with_status{_async}()`)
 *
 * - If the firmware still works even when an error happens,
 *   - The kernel driver should ask the firmware to signal the fence with an error.
 *   - Or, the kernel driver should ask the firmware to cancel all submitted signaler commands to
 *     guarantee that the fence won't be signaled by the firmware anymore and then signal the fence
 *     at the kernel level.
 *   - Or, just don't signal the fence and let the waiter commands to be timedout.
 *
 * After handling the error, the `iif_fence_signaler_completed()` function must be called at the end
 * as usual.
 *
 * Note that it is different from the case that an error happened at the firmware level while
 * handling the command and the firmware returned an error response to the kernel driver. In this
 * case, the firmware must have signaled the fence with an error and the kernel driver doesn't need
 * to error the fence out.

 *   the fence to let the IIF driver know that the fence is going to be signaled at the kernel
 *   level.
 *
 * In case of non-direct fences, this function doesn't have meaning unless the signaler IP crashed
 * and `iif_fence_set_propagate_unblock()` was called before. However, it does if the fence is a
 * direct fence to notify the IIF driver of the fence signal even when the signaler IP is alive,
 * thus the IIF driver can notify the ones polling on the kernel-level fence. To support it, it is
 * recommended to call this function by the signaler IP driver not only when the driver signals the
 * fence on behalf of the firmware, but also when the fence is signaled by the firmware.
 *
 * If the fence is a non-direct fence, the sync-unit driver will always notify the IIF driver of the
 * fence signal whenever the fence has been signaled. Therefore, the signaler IP driver doesn't need
 * to notify the IIF driver of the fence signal and the IIF driver can notify the ones polling on
 * the kernel-fence object when the sync-unit driver notifies the IIF driver. Even when the signaler
 * IP crashes and this function is called by the signaler IP driver to signal the fence, this
 * function will just ask the sync-unit to handle the fence signal and return. The IIF driver won't
 * think the fence is signaled and won't notify the kernel-fence object until the sync-unit actually
 * processes the signal and it notifies the IIF driver. (i.e., this function handles the signal
 * asynchronously internally.)
 *
 * However, in case of direct fences, there is no sync-unit and the signaler IP driver should notify
 * the IIF driver that the fence has been signaled regardless of the liveness of the signaler IP.
 * Therefore, this function will always notify the IIF driver of the fence signal if the fence is a
 * direct fence. In other words, it is mandatory to call this function if the signaler IP crashed to
 * signal the fence at the kernel-level, but also to notify the IIF driver of the fence signal even
 * when the signaler IP is alive.
 *
 * If the fence is a direct single-shot fence, the signaler IP driver may simply call this function
 * whenever it receives a response of the signaler command from its firmware. Because it implies
 * that the firmware has signaled the fence at the firmware level before returning a response and
 * the driver can call this function to notify the IIF driver of the fence signal.
 *
 * If the fence is a direct reusable fence, the signaler IP may need a specific protocol between the
 * driver and firmware because one signaler command can signal the fence multiple times. In other
 * words, the IP driver should be able to notify the IIF driver of the fence signal even before the
 * firmware returns a response. The firmware will notify the IP driver of the fence signal via the
 * protocol and the IP driver should forward the signal to the IIF driver.
 *
 * As having that kind of protocol would be too much work to support direct reusable fences, the
 * signaler IP driver is still possible to call this function only once after a signaler command has
 * been processed. However, the ones polling on the kernel-level fence will be notified only once
 * at the end.
 *
 * Based on this description, if the signaler IP driver needs to signal the fence, this function
 * must called before the driver calls `iif_fence_signaler_completed()`.
 *
 * This function can be called in the normal context only. For other contexts, use the async one
 * below.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success. Otherwise, returns a negative errno. Exceptionally, if the fence is a
 * direct single-shot fence, it will return the number of remaining signals on success.
