 * The callback function which will be called by the sync-unit driver when the underlying sync-unit
 * fence of @iif is signaled. The sync-unit driver must pass the fence status to @status.
 *
 * - Single-shot fence: If the fence is unblocked, @status->signaled must be set to true. Even
 *                      though @status->error is non-zero, if @status->signaled is false, the IIF
 *                      driver will consider the fence is sill blocked. Whether to signal the fence
 *                      or not if the fence is errored out even before all signalers signal the
 *                      fence is dependent on the implementation of the sync-unit.
 *
 * - Reusable fence: In this case, @status->signaled will be ignored and @status->timeline will be
 *                   considered to propagate the fence signal to waiters polling on the kernel-level
 *                   fence object. Waiters will register sync points and the IIF driver will notify
 *                   waiters once @status->timeline reaches one of sync points. The sync-unit driver
 *                   can invoke this callback per every single signal regardless of sync points, but
 *                   it is also recommended to consider sync points to minimize AP involevement.
 *                   Unlike single-shot fence, if @status->error is set, the error will be
 *                   propagated to all waiters immediately, even before @status->timeline reaches
 *                   the value they are waiting for. If @status->timeline reaches the timeout value,
 *                   the sync-unit must error the fence out as timeout.

	/*
	 * Called when @fence is signaled.
	 *
	 * Note: if it is possible to handle the fence signal in the IRQ context, please consider
	 * registering a poll callback to the fence instead of using this operator. As this operator
	 * is designed to be always called in the normal context which means it will be always
	 * invoked in a deferred kthread, it may have a latency issue. Also, it is not suitable to
	 * get the real-time fence signal.
	 *
	 * The purpose of this operator is mostly for propagating the fence signal to the waiter IP
	 * in these cases:
	 * - The signaler is AP.
	 * - The signaler is IP, but the signaler IP becomes faulty and it cannot propagate the
	 *   fence signal to waiters.
	 *
	 * For those cases, @fence->propagate will be set to true and the IP driver should notify
	 * its IP that the fence has been signaled (i.e., send @fence->id to IP) on behalf of the
	 * signaler. This operator returns void since the IIF driver has nothing can do when the IP
	 * driver fails to notify its IP. It is the responsibility of the IP driver side to handle
	 * if that happens.
	 *
	 * Note that the timing of @fence retirement is nondeterministic since we can't decide the
	 * timing of the runtime or IP crash. However, even if @fence->propagate is true and the
	 * fence has been retired in the middle, it should be still safe to notify the waiter IP of
	 * the fence signal since the firmware will verify whether the fence is actually signaled.
	 *
	 * If the IP driver is still going to use this operator to handle the fence signal, please
	 * refer to the comments of `iif_fence_poll_cb_t` type in the `iif-fence.h` file to
	 * understand how to handle the fence signal according to the fence type.
	 *
	 * For reusable fences, note that this operator wouldn't be signaled for every single
	 * signal. If the fence has been signaled multiple times in very short time, the timeline
	 * value can be bumped up by more than 1. For example, if the IP driver was waiting the
	 * timeline value to be 2, but the it has been increased from 1 to 3, the IP driver should
	 * be able to notice that it already passed the value it was waiting for. If the IP driver
	 * needs to know the timeline increase in real-time, please consider registering a poll
	 * callback to the fence.
