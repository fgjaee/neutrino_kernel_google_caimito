/*
 * By default, the fence will retire if there are no outstanding signalers, waiters and FDs. Its
 * purpose is to return the fence ID to the pool in early stage before the fence releases so that we
 * can minimize the possibility of the lack of fence ID. Therefore, the retirement condition will be
 * checked for each `signal()`, `waited()` and `close(fd)` call. However, when the user sets this
 * flag to a fence, the fence will retire only when it releases.
 *
 * If there is a possibility of a race condition between the signaler and waiters, this flag can be
 * considered to prevent the early fence retirement. For example, if the signaler signals a fence
 * before any waiter starts waiting on the fence, the IIF driver will think there are no outstanding
 * signalers and waiters, so it will let the fence retire. That means upcoming waiters may try to
 * wait on the retired fence which is invalid.
 *
 * Normally, that race condition doesn't have to be considered since the runtime will always hold
 * FDs while drivers/firmwares manipulating a fence and the fence won't retired in any case until
 * the runtime closes FDs. However, if there is an use case that utilizing a fence which won't be
 * exposed to the runtime (i.e., no FD is installed to the fence), this flag will be required to
 * prevent the race condition.

/*
 * Basically, IIF is supposed to be handled in the firmware-level if the signaler is non-AP.
 * However, the IIF kernel driver is still signaling the IIF kernel object so that the IP kernel
 * drivers can notice the fence unblock by registering poll callbacks or the runtime can wait for
 * the fence unblock by polling on the fence (i.e., epoll() syscall).
 *
 * If this flag is set, it will disable polling on the fence at the kernel-level so that the kernel
 * drivers or the runtime won't be notified even though they are polling on the fence. It is still
 * safe to utilize the fence functions below like normal cases, but just the fence will never notify
 * the ones polling on it.
 *
 * For example, it is still safe to call the `iif_fence_add_poll_callback()` function to register a
 * callback, but the callback will never be invoked. Also, the `iif_fence_is_signaled()` function
 * will still return true if the fence was signaled.
 *
 * Note that the `fence_unblocked()` operator registered to the `struct iif_manager` won't be
 * invoked for the fence with this flag.
